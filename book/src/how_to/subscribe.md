    * If you do not have an email address associated with your github id, you will be prompted for an email address. See also the steps for [customizing your preferences].
* There will be a listing of all upcoming events, localized to your time zone.
* Each event has a "subscribe" button -- click it and enter your email address.
    * You will receive a calendar invite.

## Subscribing to team(s)

![Status: Unimplemented](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Unimplemented-red)

You can also receive invites to all events organized by a particular team. [See the customization page](./customize.md#change-the-teams-that-you-are-subscribed-to) for more details.

## Subscribing to a calendar by URL

![Status: Unimplemented](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Unimplemented-red)

If you don't wish to receive personal invites, you can export an ICS file that you can add to your calendar. This can be convenient to see what is scheduled without having to accept/decline invitations or have those items show up as busy on your calendar.

Simply add the URL `https://calendar.example.org/ics/team.ics` and add it to your calendar.
