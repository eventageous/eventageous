# Schedule an event

## Public events

![Status: Unimplemented](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Unimplemented-red)

To schedule a public event:

* Go to your calendar of choice and create an event with `calendar+team@example.org` as an invitee. You can also add other special guests if desired.
    * You can also add other tags, such as `calendar+team1+team2@example.org`
* Once the system receives your invite, it will be auto-accepted. The invite will then be forwarded to each member of the tagged teams.
    * They can accept or decline the invite. Those responses are tracked and visible in the web interface.

## Private events

To schedule a private event:

* Add the `+private` tag to the invitee -- e.g., `calendar+team+private@example.org`
* The event will be forwarded to all members of `team` but will not be publicly visible
