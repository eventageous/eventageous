# Viewing events

## Viewing public events

![Status: Partially implemented](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Partially%20implemented-yellow)

Go to `calendar.example.org`:

* There will be a listing of all upcoming events, localized to your time zone.
* You can filter by 1 or more tags (e.g., just for team X, or team Y).
* Each event also shows people who have accepted or declined the invite.
* Some events will appear but with details omitted. Those events will be marked as "private".
    * *Question:* Should private events be visible? Maybe not.

## Viewing private events

![Status: Unimplemented](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Unimplemented-red)

Go to `calendar.example.org` and click the `login` button.

You will be prompted to enter your github login.

You will then be able to see private events, just as described above.
