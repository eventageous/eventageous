# How to setup a new Eventageous instance



## Create a Google calendar

Eventageous uses a Google calendar as its data store.
The existence of this calendar is an implementation detail and should not be exposed to users.
Once you have setup the calendar, [create API keys as described here](./contribute/setup.md#secrets).

## Configuring the teams

TBD -- we have to link this to the Rust teams repository somehow

## Setup your own shuttle instance

* Clone the repository
* Setup your `Secrets.toml`
* TBD... *or maybe we can let users configure `americano.shuttleapp.rs`?*
