# Vision

Eventageous aims to be a convenient, lightweight way for open-source communities to track their calendar.

## Goals

* Bring your own calendar software -- we don't care if you use Google calendar, Microsoft Exchange, or some purely open source solution, as long as you can send/receive standard calendar invites, you are good to go.
* Scheduling repeating and one-off events is easy
* Maintain a central web page that makes it easy to
    * see what events are taking place
    * filter by teams or categories
    * track who is available to attend a given meeting
    * request an invite to a (public) meeting for your calendar

## Non-goals

* Finding a good time to meet
